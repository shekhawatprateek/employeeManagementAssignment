# Employee Management Dashboard

**Note:** There is room for many improvements in this project, such as:  
- Using a **.env** file for better configuration management  
- Enhancing the **styling and UI** for a more polished look  
- Implementing **MongoDB** for persistent storage instead of JSON  
- Adding authentication and other advanced features  

However, as this is a standard assignment, I have kept it simple and functional.
